On October 28th, Cybersalon’s Stefan Lutschinger (Middlesex University) will be discussing the Edupunk movement as a rising phenomenon, emerging academic subculture and current paradigm shift in higher education with the American writer, columnist and blogger Anya Kamenetz, Jisc’s former Wikimedian Ambassador Martin Poulter, educational anarchist Helen Armfield, punk icon Helen Reddington a.k.a. Helen McCookerybook (The Chefs, Helen and the Horns) and media artist Larisa Blazic. We will be looking at the latest trends in instructional application design, Wikipedia assignments, the political economy of EdTech such as Google Classroom, the learnings of do-it-yourself education for punkademics, creative ways to avoid PowerPoint and how to apply the rebellious attitude and D.I.Y. ethos of punks, hackers and makers to new innovative teaching and learning practices.
